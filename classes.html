                <p>I am certified in power Vinyasa, a style of yoga where movement is sequenced with breath, 
                    and branches from the traditional yoga method of Ashtanga. Fluidity between postures 
                    helps quiet the mind and focus on the present moment. While 'power' Vinyasa insinuates 
                    vigorous movement and strength building, vinyasa can still be practiced by all levels, 
                    ages, and body types! Through our interactions I adapt each class to your level while 
                    being mindful of the flow. </p> 
                <p>I am currently offering private lessons <b>Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays</b>.</p>

                <p>I want yoga to be as accessible as possible 
                    extending across all communities! I will travel to YOU anywhere within the greater Seattle 
                    area and can bring yoga mats/props if needed at no extra charge. Please see below

                <p class="disclaimer">Note: I am willing to travel most places a reasonable distance away from where I live in Mt. Baker.
                    While I will drive anywhere within 10 miles of Mt. Baker free of charge, to facilitate 
                    other travel costs I charge $0.50/mile for any distance greater than that.

                <p>
                    I believe music is a key component to physical movement that can elevate your entire 
                    practice. I create my own playlists that I find best marry the beat with the energy 
                    level of the class. However, I know each client is different! If you have any 
                    specific music requests I'd be happy to curate a playlist specifically for you during our 
                    session. If you would prefer to play your own music I take no offense! Do what makes you 
                    most comfortable!
