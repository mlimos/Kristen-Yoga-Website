                <p>I started my yoga journey on a whim about five years ago. At the time I was 
                    struggling with mental health and yoga was suggested to me as a way to find mindful 
                    calm and ease. I had always heard of these rumored benefits but never quite understood 
                    them; I equivocated yoga with stretching which was not physical enough to really tout 
                    any significant advantages. However, after my first class I soon realized that not 
                    only is yoga physically challenging, it&#39;s extremely intimidating! There were pose 
                    names that I didn&#39;t know and people balancing on their arms when I could barely 
                    hold a plank. I felt silly and uncomfortable during meditation and I made so many 
                    countless mistakes during the pose sequence that I was certain my amateur abilities 
                    were on full display for everyone to mock. Regardless of my incessant overthinking 
                    during that class, I absolutely loved the mental challenge of listening to my body.
                </p>

                <p>From that moment forward I was inspired to start a consistent yoga practice. My 
                    passion for yoga drove me to get certified in June 2019 so that I could continually 
                    share this practice with others and instruct with anatomical safety first and 
                    foremost. I truly believe that yoga should be inclusive of everyone and I work t
                    o cultivate a welcoming atmosphere to minimize any intimidation. Over time I've 
                    learned that there&#39;s no such thing as being 'good' or 'bad' at yoga &#8208; varying levels 
                    simply exist through development on a micro level each day. 
                </p>
                <p>While I won't promise that you will experience the same benefits of yoga or discover 
                    the same meaning behind it like I did, I&#39;d love to be a part of your personal journey 
                    as one of the countless guides available to you.
